# Book Recommendation System

This project is a **Book Recommendation System** that uses Machine Learning algorithms to recommend top 50 books based on user-selected language preferences. It utilizes algorithms like Naive Bayes for classification and evaluation, with a user-friendly GUI for easy interaction. The system is designed to deliver highly relevant book recommendations and allows for seamless updates and improvements.

## Key Features
- **Book Recommendation Engine** powered by Machine Learning.
- **Naive Bayes algorithm** for recommendation evaluation and classification.
- A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for selecting language preferences and receiving top 50 book recommendations.
- **Supports multiple languages** for diverse reading preferences.
- Customizable for personalizing recommendations based on user interactions.
  
## Applications
- **Personal Reading Assistant** for avid readers.
- **Library Systems** for curating book lists.
- **E-commerce Platforms** for recommending books to customers.
- **Educational Platforms** to help students discover relevant reading materials.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for backend logic.
- **Tkinter** for creating a graphical user interface.
- **Machine Learning algorithms** like Naive Bayes for recommendation evaluation.
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn** for Machine Learning model implementation.

## How it Works
1. **Data Collection**: The system uses a dataset containing book information, including genres, language, author, and popularity ratings.
2. **Model Training**: A Naive Bayes classifier is trained on the dataset to predict the relevance of a book based on the selected language and other features.
3. **GUI Interaction**: Users can select their preferred language through the GUI. Once a language is selected, the system recommends the **top 50 books** in that language.
4. **Real-Time Interaction**: Recommendations are updated in real-time based on the selected preferences. The system allows users to fine-tune their preferences for even more personalized recommendations.
